    "transcript": "Vega: 'Where did they pick you up from?' Officer: '...Hobby Town... Hobby Lobby... but they said 1789...'",
    "significance": "Confirms the location data points discussed in the 'Scapegoat Gambit' regarding his intended destination (Hobby Town) vs. where he ended up, reinforcing that he was taken off course by the hijackers.",

    "parent_summary": "This video captures the intake and booking process of Michael Vega at the Lake County Jail following the vehicle pursuit incident. It documents his physical state as a triple amputee, his interactions with law enforcement and jail staff, and the subsequent medical evaluation. The footage highlights his extreme physical vulnerability (requiring assistance for basic movement), his confusion regarding the situation, and his consistent denial of physical injury despite being processed for medical clearance due to police protocol. The video also captures officers discussing the other occupants of the vehicle (Foster/\"Becker\" and Allen) and Vega's emotional distress."

    "description": "Vega asks the officer, 'Are you hurt at all from the chase?' referring to his own 'heart hurting'. The officer clarifies he means physical pain. Vega says, 'My heart hurts.'",
    "transcript": "Officer: 'Are you hurt at all from the chase?' Vega: 'Yeah.' Officer: 'Like how?' Vega: 'My heart.' Officer: 'Your heart? Like physically or emotionally?' Vega: 'Like... not physically.'",
    "significance": "CRITICAL KEY MOMENT. Vega explicitly clarifies his pain is NOT physical but emotional ('not physically'). This demonstrates high integrity; he refuses to fake a physical injury to get hospital treatment or sympathy, unlike Foster who allegedly feigned an overdose. This bolsters his credibility and humanizes his trauma ('The Illusion of Choice').",

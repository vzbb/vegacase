    "parent_summary": "Interior footage of Mr. Vega in the back of the police cruiser during transport. The video captures critical dialogue between Vega and the transporting officer. Vega explains his congenital disability, asserts his innocent original intent (Hobby Town), claims he attempted to stop the vehicle but was unable to (supporting the duress defense), and expresses profound fear ('praying to get out'). A key moment of police aggression is recorded when the officer admits he wanted to use a PIT maneuver on the disabled defendant but was overruled by a supervisor."

    "transcript": "Vega: 'Thank you for not doing the P.I.T. maneuver.' Officer: 'I was letting you know... thank my supervisor... don't thank me, I would have done it.'",
    "significance": "Demonstrates potential 'Outrageous Government Conduct' and police aggression. An officer admits a willingness to use potentially lethal force (PIT) on a known triple-amputee driver, which could have been catastrophic given Vega's 'Medical Vulnerability' (dislocated hip, prototype implant). It highlights the extreme danger Vega faced from both the criminals inside the car and the police outside.",

    "transcript": "19-6 to dispatch... confirming Ed Becker.",
    "significance": "Direct evidence of 'The Becker Contagion.' This clip proves that the false identity provided by Christopher Foster was actively being entered into the official record and communicated across channels, solidifying the systemic error that allowed a 'Most Wanted' fugitive to escape justice.",

    "parent_summary": "This video captures the aftermath of the arrest and booking attempt. It begins with the officer completing paperwork in his cruiser, where the 'Ed Becker' alias is further cemented over the radio. The officer then meets with Mr. Vega's mother and Danielle Allen (the female passenger who fled) in a parking lot. Despite knowing Allen fled the vehicle, the officer treats her as a witness rather than a suspect. The video culminates in a scene where Mr. Vega, shirtless and helpless in the back of a patrol car, is berated by the officer and his mother before being released into her custody because the jail refused to admit him due to his medical condition."

    "transcript": "Officer: 'How you doing?' Mother: 'I'm Michael's mother.' ... Allen: 'I was in the car.'",
    "significance": "Crucial for the 'Coordinated Extraction' and 'Selective Prosecution' arguments. Danielle Allen, who fled the scene and allegedly controlled the vehicle, is standing freely in a parking lot. The officer knows who she is and that she was involved, yet she is not in handcuffs, highlighting the inexplicable disparity in how she is treated compared to the disabled Mr. Vega.",

    "transcript": "His friend OD'd in the back... Danielle jumped out... he kept going.",
    "significance": "This establishes 'The Scapegoat Gambit.' The officer acknowledges the chaotic elements introduced by the passengers\u2014Foster's overdose (which we know was faked) and Allen's flight. Despite acknowledging these mitigating factors and the chaotic environment inside the car, the focus remains entirely on penalizing Vega.",

    "transcript": "Officer: 'No clothes, no walker, hanging out with the s*** that you've been hanging out with. Apologize to this man!' Mother: 'I didn't raise you that way.'",
    "significance": "This scene is vital for the 'Illusion of Choice' and medical defense. Vega's posture and silence are consistent with the 'freeze/appease' trauma response described in his medical profile. He is physically helpless ('no walker') and verbally battered, yet offers no resistance. It humanizes him as a broken man rather than a defiant criminal and visually underscores his vulnerability.",

    "significance": "The 'smoking gun' for 'The Unconscionable Price' argument. This clip confirms that the jail refused to accept Mr. Vega, forcing the police to release him to his mother. It serves as irrefutable proof that the state lacks the capacity to safely incarcerate him, supporting the argument that any future custodial sentence would be unconstitutional.",
